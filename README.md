# Date_counting_back_and_forwards
# javasript. Node.js


Count date backwards or forwards.

Here we count date backwards.

```
var date = new Date();
console.log("Today's Date: " + date + "</b><br>" );
date.setDate(-12);
console.log ( "The day we get after subtracting is: " + date); 
     
```

Output
```
Today's Date: Wed Mar 01 2023 13:34:23 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)</b><br>
The day we get after subtracting is: Thu Feb 16 2023 13:34:23 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)

```
